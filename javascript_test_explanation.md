describe('sum', function() { })
```
### Summary
<p>
This code is an example of using Mocha.js testing framework to define a test suite for a JavaScript function called <code>sum()</code>. A test suite is a collection of test cases that are related to a particular feature or functionality of a codebase.

<p>
The <code>describe()</code> function is used in Mocha.js to define a test suite. The first argument to the <code>describe()</code> function is a string that describes what the test suite is checking. In this case, the description is "sum", which means that this test suite is checking the functionality of the <code>sum()</code> function.
</p>

<p>
The second argument to the <code>describe()</code> function is a callback function that contains the actual test cases. In this example, the callback function is empty, which means that there are no actual test cases defined yet.
</p>

<p>
Inside this callback function, you can define one or more test cases using the <code>it()</code> function. Each test case defined using the <code>it()</code> function should contain a description of what it's testing and an assertion that verifies whether the code under test behaves as expected.

## it should return 3 when passed 1 and 2
```
  it('should return 3 when passed 1 and 2', function() {
    assert.equal(sum(1, 2), 3);
  });
```
### Summary
<p>In summary, this line of code defines a test case that checks if the <code>sum()</code> function returns the expected output when called with the arguments 1 and 2. If the test case passes, it means that the <code>sum()</code> function is working correctly; if it fails, it indicates that there may be a bug in the code.</p>

<summary>Full Explanation</summary>
<br>
<p>The <code>it()</code> function is used in Mocha.js to define a single test case. In this case, the test case is checking if a function returns the expected output when passed two arguments.</p>

<p>The first argument to <code>it()</code> is a description of the test case, which is meant to be human-readable and should explain what the test is checking.</p>

<p>The second argument to <code>it()</code> is a callback function that contains the actual test code. This function is executed when the test case is run, and it typically contains one or more assertions that verify the behavior of the code being tested.</p>

<p>In this particular test case, the <code>assert.equal()</code> function is used to check if the <code>sum()</code> function returns the expected output when called with the arguments 1 and 2. The <code>assert.equal()</code> function takes two arguments: the actual output of the <code>sum()</code> function (which is sum(1, 2)), and the expected output (which is 3). If the two values are equal, the test case passes; otherwise, it fails.</p>

<hr>

## it should return 0 when passed 0 and 0
```
  it('should return 0 when passed 0 and 0', function() {
    assert.equal(sum(0, 0), 0);
  });
```

### Summary
This code defines a test case that checks whether the <code>sum()</code> function returns 0 when called with two arguments that are both 0. If the test case passes, it means that the <code>sum()</code> function is working correctly for this particular input; if it fails, it indicates that there may be a bug in the code that needs to be fixed.

## it should return -1 when passed 0 and -1
```
  it('should return -1 when passed 0 and -1', function() {
    assert.equal(sum(0, -1), -1);
  });
```

### Summary
The purpose of this test case is to check whether a JavaScript function called <code>sum()</code> returns the expected output when passed two arguments, 0 and -1.

If the test case passes, it means that the <code>sum()</code> function is working correctly for this particular input; if it fails, it indicates that there may be a bug in the code that needs to be fixed.
